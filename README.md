# Overview
This project involves analyzing and predicting life expectancy using a dataset from Kaggle. The project includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and applying machine learning techniques to make predictions.

# Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Necessary Python libraries (listed in requirements.txt)

# Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/TannerYoung13/capstone-young
2. Install required packages: pip install -r requirements.txt

# How to create a Jupyter Notebook
1. Open Terminal: Ctrl+ or select Terminal > New Terminal.
2. Install Jupyter: pip install jupyter
3. Create a New Notebook: Press Ctrl+Shift+P to open the Command Palette.
Type Jupyter: Create New Blank Notebook and select it.
4. Run a Code Cell: Enter the following code in the first cell:
print("Hello, Jupyter Notebook in VS Code!")
Run the cell by clicking the Run button (play icon) next to the cell or by pressing Shift+Enter.

# Data set
The data set is from Kaggle and can be downloaded here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arunjangir245/life-expectancy-data/data

# Machine Learning 
1. The Random Forest Regressor was used due to its robustness and ability to handle various data types.
2. The data was split into training and testing sets, standardized, and the model was evaluated using metrics like R-squared.
